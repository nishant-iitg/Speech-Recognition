    CONSOLE APPLICATION : CodebookGeneration Project Overview
========================================================================

Both K Means and LBZ algorithm is used to generate the codebook and splitting parameter is taken as 0.03 in this program.
The threshold for stopping the K means is take as 0.01.

********************************************************************************************
Generating Universe:
Take all the refernce Ci values for all 5 utterences from the former experiment and then put it in universe.txt

********************************************************************************************

Important files:-
1.Universe.txt :- contains universe 125 vectors of 12 dimensions which are taken out of the vowel recognition experiment.
2. codebook_kmeans.txt :- codebook of size 8 vectores generated by k means algorithm
3.codebook_lbg.txt :-  contains generated code book of size 8 (8 representitve vectors of 12 dimensions) genrated by lbg algorithm

*********************************************************************************************

How to Run?
1.Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Build and run it.
3. Give option that whether you want to generate codebook with k means algorithm or with LBG algorithm.
4. If Kmeans is selected then program outputs the bin sizes of each iteration (sizes of the clusteres) and difference between old and new distortions and finally prints the codebook generated.
5. If LBG option is selected then the program outputs (first the centroid from which we start splitting then prints the distortion differences of each iterations until k mean become stabalized and finally it prints the rows of the codebook generated).

********************************************************************************************
Code is modular and properly commented. It can be seen for further checking implementation.
